# Image Size Demo Page

This page is used to demonstrate the visual quality differences between images of different resolution and encoding quality in relation to the size with which they are presented in the HTML page. 
It requires an online storage location (e.g. an Azure blob storage account) that holds the images of different sizes. 
Their URLs and properties are set in the 'images' array in Javascript, and the slider bar on the top of the page can be used to change the dimensions with which they are rendered on the page.
